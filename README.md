A **manifold** is a topological space $\mathcal{M}=(X,\tau)$ that is

1. **Hausdorff**: for each $x,y\in X$ with $x\not=y$, there exists open sets $U_x, U_y$ such that $U_x\cap U_y=\phi.$

2. **Second-Countable**: the topology $\tau$ admits a countable basis.

3. **Locally Euclidean of Dimension $n$**: for each $x\in X$, there exists some open neighborhood $U_x\in\tau$ and a homeomorphism $\varphi: U\mapsto U'\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. Such a homeomorphism $\varphi$ is called a chart of $\mathcal{M}$.
